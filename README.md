# django-react-app-sample

just a quick tutorial from http://owaislone.org/blog/webpack-plus-reactjs-and-django/, which is a step by step guide on setting up webpack with django using `django-webpack-loader` library.

basically a simple react app and use webpack to compile, also on the django side, use `django-webpack-loader` to include bundle in html pages.
